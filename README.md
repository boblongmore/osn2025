There is a formal definition of TOIL, which is:

```text
"TOIL is the kind of work tied to running a production service that tends to be manual, repetitive, automatable,
tactical devoid of enduring value and that scales linearly as a service grows.‚Äù
```



The way I define toil is doing things that are boring and can't scale. The drudgery of doing the same thing over and over again. Doing the things that I hate to do.

In this talk I present ways in which we automated toil out of our daily lives.
Ways in which I've automated toil for my personal life. And finallly ways in which I've seen Enterprise organizations automate toil.
